## Amazon Cognito SCIM user management

This solution is a lightweight SCIM interface for Cogntio that leverages Amazon API Gateway and Lamda functions to facilitate the following actions: 
- Listing Cognito User IDs
- Update Cognito users
- Delete Cognito users

>[!IMPORTANT]
> This solution currently does not **create** Cognito users. This is because Cognito supports just-in-time (JIT) user creation by default.
